#### Phase 2.3: Assignment Agents

5. **Team Routing Agent**

   - **Purpose**: Determines best team for ticket handling
   - **Database Interactions**:
     - Reads from:
       - `teams` (team capabilities)
       - `team_members` (team composition)
       - `ticket_research_findings` (complexity scores)
     - Writes to:

### Agent Interaction Flow

#### Main Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New Ticket] --> B[Classifier Agent]
    B --> C[Research Agent]
    C --> D{Complexity Check}
    D -->|Complex| E[Priority Agent]
    D -->|Simple| F[SLA Agent]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Team Routing Agent]
    G --> H[Agent Assignment Agent]
    H --> I[Final Assignment]

    %% Feedback Loops
    I -.->|Performance Data| C
    I -.->|Update Patterns| B
```

#### Database Schema Interactions

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Tickets Table] --- B[Research Findings Table]
    A --- C[SLA Metrics Table]
    A --- D[Priority Metrics Table]
    A --- E[Resolution History Table]
    A --- F[Agent Performance Table]
    A --- G[Team Routing Metrics Table]
```

### Agent Communication Patterns

1. **Sequential Processing**

   - Classifier ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Priority ‚Üí SLA ‚Üí Routing ‚Üí Assignment
   - Each agent waits for previous agent's completion
   - Data passed through database state changes

2. **Feedback Loops**

   - Resolution outcomes feed back to Research Agent
   - Agent performance metrics update routing decisions
   - Pattern recognition improves classification accuracy

3. **Parallel Operations**
   - SLA monitoring runs independently
   - Pattern analysis runs in background
   - Performance metric collection is continuous

### Performance Monitoring

Each agent reports to a central monitoring system:

- Accuracy metrics
- Processing time
- Decision confidence
- Resource usage
- Error rates

### Fallback Mechanisms

Each agent has built-in fallbacks:

- Default classifications if Classifier fails
- Manual routing options if automated routing fails
- SLA defaults for new ticket types
- Backup assignment rules for edge cases
