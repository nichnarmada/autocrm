   - **Functions**:
     - `classifyTicket()`
     - `calculateConfidence()`
     - `provideReasoning()`
   - **Triggers**: New ticket creation, Major ticket updates

2. **Team Routing Agent**

       - `teams` (team capabilities)
       - `team_members` (team composition)
       - `tickets` (category, priority)
     - Writes to:
       - `tickets` (team_id)
       - `team_routing_metrics` (new table)
   - **Functions**:
     - `analyzeTeamCapabilities()`

     - Writes to:
       - `tickets` (priority)
       - `ticket_priority_metrics` (new table)
   - **Functions**:
     - `assessPriority()`
     - `calculateBusinessImpact()`
     - `predictEscalationRisk()`
   - **Triggers**: After Research Agent completes, Priority review requests

4. **SLA Agent**

   - **Purpose**: Manages response and resolution timeframes
   - **Database Interactions**:
     - Reads from:
       - `tickets` (priority, category)
       - `ticket_sla_metrics` (new table)
     - Writes to:
       - `ticket_sla_metrics` (deadlines, warnings)
   - **Functions**:
